# Diamonds_Prediction_Project


General Look

This is a project was created by Mohammad Habash and me. And special thanks to SHAI Academy.

The project is about building a machine learning model to predict the prices of diamonds according to their features, after training the machine learning model on training sets of a labeled data set. 
The documentation shows the steps we did to clean, optimize and prepare the data, and how we chose the best model for the project with the best accuracy.
Diamond prices data set was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds .
